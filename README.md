# House Rent Prediction & Analysis



## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes how features like **City, Size, Furnishing Status, and Tenant Preference** impact rental prices. The goal is to identify key market drivers and provide data-driven recommendations for the real estate sector.

## 📊 Key Business Insights
* **Location Premium:** Mumbai is the most expensive market, while Kolkata offers the highest affordability.
* **Value Drivers:** Number of Bathrooms and BHK are stronger predictors of rent than raw square footage.
* **ROI on Furnishing:** Moving from Unfurnished to Furnished significantly increases rental yield.
* **Market Segmentation:** Properties listed by 'Carpet Area' and those preferred by 'Families' command the highest price premiums.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## 📈 Modeling Strategy
* **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing distributions, city-wise trends, and feature correlations.
* **Linear Regression:** Building a baseline model to predict the dependent variable (Rent).
* **Recommendations:** Suggested Log Transformation to handle right-skewed data and addressing multicollinearity between Size and BHK.

## 🚀 Future Work
* Implement Advanced Regressors (Random Forest, XGBoost).
* Advanced Outlier Detection to handle luxury properties.
* Feature engineering for "Price per Sqft".
